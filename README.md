# 30 Days Of Solidity

This repository would contain 30 or more Solidity smart contract Projects with explaining different concepts. Main purpose of this to teach you smart contract development; 
hopefully.

## How to Use

Each folder is dedicated to each day.

Go to the contracts subfolder and go through the smart contract files. You can skip the `Migrations.sol` file it is used for keeping record of contracts.

Go ahead to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to try the code by yourself.

Also, feel free to drop an issue if have any questions.

Happy learning üòÅ
